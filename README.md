# React Tube Line Challenge

Weâ€™d like you to build an App to monitor the current status of the London Underground.

Using the TFL API (https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status), build a mobile-oriented web app that:
- Lists the London Underground lines sorted alphabetically
- Shows the current status of each line
- Bonus 1: Each line should be its own **Line** component
- Bonus 2: Each Line styled in some way using its appropriate color (e.g. Central line with 'red' font)
- Bonus 3: Updates the status every 5 minutes (really think about this!)

Feel free to style the app as you wish, but see "example.png" for a rough idea on what to produce.


## Tips
  Remember to test endpoints with Insomnia before attempting to use them in your code.
  Use your Chrome Developer Tools and `console.log`!
